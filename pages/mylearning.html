<h2>How to Write a Poem Using HTML</h2>
<h3>Heading and Paragraph Tags</h3>
<p>Using heading and paragraph tags are very important when using HTML especially<br>when writing a poem as you need to be careful that you do not use more than<br>necessary. When writing a poem in HTML you actually only need one heading tag for<br>the title of your poem and one paragraph tag for the body of your poem. Your entire<br>poem should be inside the paragraph start and end tag without using the enter key<br>between lines but by using specific tags.</p>

<h3>Break Tags</h3>
<p>Writing a poem using HTML is really quite simple once you know the correct tags,<br>and where to place them. Surprisingly there are not many tags that need to be used.<br>Commonly in poems after every sentence or two you begin to write again on the<br>next line. When using HTML, you do not even need to press enter on your keyboard<br>all you need is a break tag, also known as a br tag. By using these break tags, you<br>only need to use one heading tag and one paragraph tag.</p>

<h3>Using Colors</h3>
<p>Colors can be used by linking an external style sheet but can also be used using<br>inline style tags. This way you can make only certain lines of the poem the specific<br>color that you would like. Here what you would have to do instead of just adding<br>a style tag and typing in a color, you need to put span tags before and after you<br>have typed in what color you would like the specific text to show in.</p>

<h3>Inline Tags</h3>
<p>In poems text is very commonly either bolded or italicized to add a nice look.<br>By using the correct inline tags this is made possible with HTML. The tags are also<br>quite easy to remember, the bold and italics tag is just the letter that the words bold<br>and italics begins with. As long as you put the tags in the write place, one at the<br>beginning of the text and one at the end, the text will be changed very easily.</p>

<h2>How to Make a List Using HTML</h2>
<h3>Inline Tags</h3>
<p>When making a list there a many different tags that need to be used to make sure<br>that the list is set up correctly. Not only are there heading tags being used here, there<br>are also different types of list tags. These tags are used to let the computer know what<br>type of list you want to be shown and where you want the items in the list to be<br>displayed. There are four different types of lists all with their own tags for the type<br>of list. There are also list item tags in the list.</p>
<h3>Types of Lists</h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>Unordered List</b></dt>
<dd>An unordered list is simply a list where the items in it are listed randomly and<br>usually bulleted. This is the type of list you would use when you are not rating<br>things, for example this would work for a grocery list. When attempting to<br>create this type of list using HTML you need to use an ul tag which stands for<br>unordered list. Inside of this list you need to use li tags to let the computer<br>know that you are now typing in the actual items of the list. One li start and<br> end tag is needed for each item of the list.</dd>
<h3>Grocery List Items</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Apples</li>
    <li>Bananas</li>
    <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul><br>
<dt><b>Ordered List</b></dt>
<dd>An ordered list is the exact opposite of the unordered list. Here the list items<br>are organized and numbered. You could use this type of list when rating things<br>or writing the steps for a recipe. In order to make this type of list while using<br>HTML, you need to use an ol tag to show that you would like to create an<br>ordered list. Inside of the list you need li tags for each item of your list, they<br>will be listed and numbered in the order which you type them in. There is also<br>the option of numbering the list with different symbols such as roman numerals.<br>All that is needed to do this is to add a type tag and for roman numerals the type is I.</dd>
<h3>My Current Top 5 Soccer Teams</h3>
<ol type=I>
    <li>Bayern Munich</li>
    <li>Liverpool</li>
    <li>Manchester City</li>
    <li>Paris Saint-Germain</li>
    <li>Real Madrid</li>
</ol><br>
<dt><b>Description List</b></dt>
<dd>A description list is where there are items randomly listed with descriptions<br>under them. This type of list can be used whenever you want to list things with<br>an explanation. This list can be used when wanting to list the rules of a game or<br>a sport where you want to describe the rule for people who do not know what the<br>rule means. For this list the tags are a little bit different. There is a tag to let the<br>computer know what type of list you are trying to create like usual. The difference<br>is the item tags. For the item listed or the heading of the description you need<br>a dt start and end tag. For the actual descriptions of the list you will need a dd tag,<br>and just like the list items for the other lists you will need a dd start and end tag for<br>every description.</dd>
<h3>Soccer Rules</h3>
<d1>
    <dt><b>Penalty Kick</b></dt>
    <dd>When a player is fouled inside the penalty box.</dd>
    <dt><b>Throw In</b></dt>
    <dd>When the ball is kicked out of play by the opposition, the player throws the ball<br>in to resume play.</dd>
    <dt><b>Offside</b></dt>
    <dd>This is when a player is behind all the defense and gets the ball passed to them<br>which is not allowed.</dd>
    <dt><b>Pass Back</b></dt>
    <dd>When a player passes the ball back to his goalie and the goalie picks up the ball<br>an indirect free kick is given as this is not allowed.</dd>
    <dt><b>Red Card</b></dt>
    <dd>When a player commits a very bad foul he receives a red card and his team plays<br>a man down after he is ejected from the game.</dd>
    </d1><br><br>
<dt><b>Nested List</b></dt>
<dd>A nested list is a little bit more complicated because it is a combination of two lists.<br>In a nested list there is an ordered list inside of an unordered list. This can be used for<br>things such as listing your favourite restaurants randomly and ranking your favourite<br>meals from there. Here you need to start with a ul tag and then add your list items with<br>li tags. Inside those li tags you need to create a separate ordered list under each listed<br>item. You would then need list items inside those miniature ordered lists labeled by li<br>tags. This is where you would rank your favourite meals from your favourite restaurant<br>for example. <br></dd>

<h2>How to Make a Table Using HTML</h2>
<h3>Table Headings</h3>
<p>When creating a table using HTML you will first need a a table tag, and then a heading tag to<br>create a name for your table. If you do not want the default table width you also will need to<br>set a width by using a style tag before any of your table row tags. Then you need to create the<br>first row of the table which is your table headings. First you need a tr tag to let the computer<br>know you are making a row of your table. Inside the start and end table row tag you will need<br>your table heading for each column of your table. You will then need to use th tags for each heading.</p>
<table style="width:50%">

    <tr>
        <th>Club Name</th>
        <th>Country</th>
        <th>Club President</th>
        <th>Total Club Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1. Real Madrid</td>
        <td>Spain</td>
        <td>Florentino Perez</td>
        <td>&euro;3.8 Billion</td>
    <tr>
        <td>2. Barcelona</td>
        <td>Spain</td>
        <td>Josep Maria Bartomeu</td>
        <td>&euro;3.6 Billion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3. Manchester United</td>
        <td>England</td>
        <td>Joel Glazer/Avram Glazer</td>
        <td>&euro;3.4 Billion</td>
       
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4. Bayern Munich</td>
        <td>Germany</td>
        <td>Herbert Hainer</td>
        <td>&euro;2.7 Billion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5. Manchester City</td>
        <td>England</td>
        <td>Ferran Soriano</td>
        <td>&euro;2.4 Billion</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
<h3>Table Rows and Content</h3>
<p>After creating your first row of the table and its headings the actual content of the table has<br>to be created. When typing out what you want in your table you will need to take very<br>similar steps when creating the rest of your table rows. First off you need a tr tag to let the<br>computer know that you are creating another row of your table. This time the difference is that<br>instead of th tags you will be using td tags. This is where the content of your table will be. When<br>writing out your certain number of rows make sure that you are not typing your content in column<br>form but in row form, this is very easy to get mixed up with.</p>

<h2>Three Ways to Use CSS</h2>
<h3>Inline CSS</h3>
<p>There are three main ways to use CSS and inline CSS is one way of doing it, it is also the simplest way<br>in my opinion. When using inline CSS you will have to put certain tags in your HTML document all in<br>one line. When you do this, you can change things such as font, font size, font color, background<br>color, and text alignment. What is needed here is to put a style tag in front of whichever tag or element<br>you want there to be changes in. After doing this you will need to write down all of your changes with<br>semicolons separating each change. You will also need to put quotations around all of your changes. You<br>will then need to type in a closing angle bracket followed by your heading or paragraph content, then the<br>end tag of the line.</p>
<img src="/images/inlinecss.png" alt="Inline CSS" width=500px;>
<h3>Internal CSS</h3>
<p>Internal CSS is another way to incorporate CSS into your HTML document. Just like inline CSS these CSS<br>changes will be made inside of your HTML document. The difference here being you will be using curly<br>brackets and entering the data on different lines. With internal CSS and all forms of CSS there are several<br>things that you can change to add a more professional look to your page. In order to create your internal<br> styles you will need to add a code in front of whichever element or tag you would like to change, for<br>example you could change all of your h1's to be the color blue. In order to do this, you would type in an<br>open curly bracket in front of the tag and enter down as many lines as you need. Make sure to make a<br>new line for each change. Then once you are done typing your changes enter down one more line and<br>close the style changes by using a closing curly bracket. You have now created an internal stylesheet.</p>
<img src="/images/internalcss.png" alt="Internal CSS" width=400px;>
<h3>External CSS</h3>
<p>Using an external stylesheet is another way to use CSS and styles in your HTML document. There is one<br>major difference comparing to other ways of incorporating CSS into your HTML document. The difference<br>is this code will not be typed into the HTML document, you will need to create another page which is not<br>an HTML page, it will be a CSS page. You will need to create an external stylesheet which is very similar<br>to an internal stylesheet. The main difference with an external stylesheet is that it is a separate page that<br>is not actually in the HTML page. Since the stylesheet is external you need to link it or connect it to the<br>HTML page in order for everything to work. You will need to put a link to your external stylesheet in the<br>head section of your document. When linking the stylesheet make sure you have quotations and all the right<br>tags to make sure that your page will be styled exactly the way you want it.</p>

<h3>Div and ID Tags</h3>
<p>Div and id tags are very useful especially when using external stylesheets. Usually you will want most of<br>your pages to look the same or similar. Although on certain occasions you may need one of your pages<br>or a section of your page to look different then the others. For example, you might have all your<br>paragraph tags set to be red with no borders, but you want your paragraphs on a certain page with borders.<br>This is where a div and id tag might come in handy. What you would do in this situation is you would put a<br>div tag at the start and end of the section that you want to be changed in the HTML document. Inside your<br>start div tag you would use an id tag and create an id for your section, you would then type your keyword in<br>quotations. After you have done this you will need to go to your external stylesheet and create your styles<br>just like for everything else just type in the changes you want for this part of the document. The difference<br>here is, instead of typing a tag before the curly bracket you would type in your keyword that was used in<br>your id tag with a hashtag before it.</p>

<h2>Absolute and Relative Links</h2>
<h3>Absolute Links</h3>
<p>There are two types of links used in HTML and the first one is probably the most common and is seen being<br>used quite often. This type of link is called an absolute link. An absolute link is a link that contains a URL<br>pointing to another website. This is the type of link you would see on the top of your screen when searching<br>things in a browser. You can also use these types of links in HTML documents. With an absolute link you<br>are giving the viewer a path directly to the website that the link is displaying. For this type of link, you need<br>an href tag and in quotations you would paste in your link. After your link you would also need to type in what<br>you want your hyperlink to show as inside of angle brackets.</p>
<img src="/images/absolutelink.png" alt="Absolute Link" width=650px;>
<h3>Relative Links</h3>
<p>A relative link is the other type of link that is used in HTML. The difference with this type of link is that<br>instead of linking a direct path to a website it is giving information linking to a file location or a location<br>within the website. These links are typically shorter and much easier to read. For example, if you were<br>trying to link an image that you have saved somewhere on your computer you would use this type of link<br>directing the viewer to your file location and telling the computer which image to show. For this type of<br>link you would need an img src tag before typing in the file location of your image. For a relative link you<br>also need an alt tag with the name of the image in quotations so that the reader can tell what is in the spot of<br>your image in the case of them not being able to see the image for whatever reason. There is also the possibility<br>of using an href tag like the absolute links if you are trying to link to another page of yours within the website.<br>The difference would be that you would type in your folder and file name instead of a website URL.</p>

<h2>File Hierarchy/Organization</h2>
<p>File Hierarchy is one of the most important if not the most important thing when using HTML and CSS, if your<br>files are not organized correctly then things can get very tricky. All types of things can go wrong, one big one<br>is that relative links will be especially hard to use and if they do somehow work they will not be linked to the<br>right page. Having a parent folder where all of your child folders are located is very important so that you can<br>link items to your files very easily and stay organized. It is also important to have a folder for each type of<br>file, you should have one for HTML pages, one for CSS pages, and one for images.</p>
